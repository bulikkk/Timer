<h3>Pattern of delivery timer that is easy to use in every web store</h3>

<p>Right now it is set to count to 4 p.m. every day except saturdays and sundays. It is easy to adapt by changeing actual time from 16
to required hour.</p>
<p>When it counts to 00:00:00, it starts again from 24:00:00.</p>

<p>Every friday after 4:00:01 p.m., saturday and sunday Timer automatically adds 48 or 24 more hours to counter.</p>

<p>At the moment Timer looks exactly like this, but You can easily customize it by changeing "style.css" file:</p>
